#Core Developer Concepts Behind OAuth2 for Signup
- OAuth2 Components You Need:
1. OAuth2 Provider: This is the external service (e.g., Google, Facebook) that handles user authentication and gives you authorization tokens. Each provider has its own API (like Google OAuth2, GitHub OAuth2) and requires you to register your app with them.

2. Client ID and Client Secret: You register your website with the OAuth2 provider to get a Client ID and Client Secret. These are used to authenticate your app with the provider’s API.

3. Redirect URI (Callback URL): This is the URL to which the provider will send the user after they authenticate. It will include the authorization code that you’ll exchange for an access token.

4. Authorization Code: This is a temporary code you get after the user logs in and consents to provide data. It is exchanged for an access token.

5. Access Token: This token allows your server to make authenticated requests on behalf of the user, such as fetching their profile or email address from the provider.

6. Refresh Token (optional): A long-lived token used to request a new access token without needing the user to re-authenticate once the original access token expires.
